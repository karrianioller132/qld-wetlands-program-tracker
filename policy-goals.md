# Queensland Wetlands Program - Core Goals and Strategies

This document outlines the main objectives and key strategies of the Queensland Wetlands Program (QWP), a comprehensive initiative aimed at enabling sustainable wetland management across Queensland.

## 1. Nature‑Positive Wetland Management

The program adopts a **nature‑positive approach** that prioritises the protection, conservation, and rehabilitation of wetland ecosystems. This means:

- Halting and reversing wetland loss and degradation.
- Enhancing the ecological resilience of wetlands to climate change and other pressures.
- Ensuring that wetland management decisions contribute to net‑positive outcomes for biodiversity, water quality, and ecosystem services.

## 2. Evidence‑Based Tools and Information

A cornerstone of the QWP is the provision of **scientifically robust tools and data** that support informed decision‑making. Key actions include:

- Maintaining and expanding the **WetlandInfo** portal, which offers mapping, classification, assessment, and rehabilitation guidance.
- Developing and deploying the **Wetland Condition Assessment Tool (WetCAT)** to standardise wetland health evaluations.
- Producing catchment‑scale stories and classification schemes (e.g., Queensland Intertidal and Subtidal Classification Scheme) that improve ecosystem mapping and understanding.

## 3. Integrated, Multi‑Stakeholder Collaboration

The program fosters **collaborative governance** and **whole‑of‑system management** by:

- Engaging local, state, and federal government agencies, landowners, regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) bodies, and First Nations communities.
- Expanding the **Queensland Governance Group** and **Queensland Wetlands Network** to enhance inter‑agency coordination and knowledge sharing.
- Applying a **‘Whole of System, Values‑Based Framework’** that integrates ecological, cultural, and economic values into policy and on‑ground actions.

*These three pillars—nature‑positive management, evidence‑based tools, and inclusive collaboration—form the foundation of the Queensland Wetlands Program’s efforts to safeguard Queensland’s wetland ecosystems for future generations.*
